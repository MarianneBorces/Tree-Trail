Tree-Trail
==========

## Installation

1. Install XAMPP. Please refer to the XAMPP installation instructions for your 
platform.

2. Inside `htdocs`, clone this repo. Note that we're using `https` instead of 
`ssh`. That's because some firewalls block ssh, especially coffee shops and 
schools.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/fskreuz/Tree-Trail.git

    ```

3. TODO: Include initial DB dump to repo and add import/export instructions.

## Running

Run XAMPP and visit this url:

```
http://localhost/Tree-Trail

```
